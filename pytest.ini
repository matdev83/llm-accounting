; TODO: Configure packaging test to run last, ideally using pytest-depends
; This can be done by installing pytest-depends and then using:
; @pytest.mark.depends(on=["other_tests_marker_or_names"])
; or by creating a custom plugin to order tests.
; For now, consider running packaging tests separately or last manually if needed.
